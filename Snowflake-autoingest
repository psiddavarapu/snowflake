1.	An external stage is created over an S3 bucket. There are no changes in requirements to the external stage as provided by Snowflake.
2.	Assuming that a suitable table already exists, a pipe is created with the special flag "auto_ingest=true" (detailed steps below).
3.	Now this pipe will be bound to this stage location using an AWS SQS queue as a notification channel. This notification channel can be seen by doing a "SHOW STAGES" command and next to the stage to which the pipe was bound. (Special details on the SHOW STAGES command below).
4.	This SQS ARN should then be set on the S3 bucket hosting the stage as a notification configuration for the CreatedObject event. This step is outside the purview of Snowflake and is done using AWS tools (SDK/CLI/Console).
5.	Once the notification ARN has been set on the bucket, all new files created under the stage location will be loaded through the associated auto_ingest pipes for that stage to the respective tables as defined by the pipes.
